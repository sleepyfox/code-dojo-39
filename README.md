# Kata: Sing a song (refactoring)

https://github.com/sleepyfox/code-dojo-39

## Objective

Here, you will find the code to produce a popular children's nursary rhyme, produced by a web agency for the customer last year.

The customer now desires to produce multiple different versions of the song using the same structure but based on different themes, for example a current popular children's movie featuring a cast of animals.

The customer asks that you make the song configurable for different lists of animals. They cannot guarantee that there will be the same number of animals in each different version.

Refactor the code to allow for the customer's needs.

No documentation or tests were provided by the previous developer.

_Remember: refactoring can only be done in the presence of tests that are passing, and after refactoring the tests still pass!_
